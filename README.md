This is a basic Brainfuck interpreter written in C++. I made this for learning purposes and any patches are welcome!

## What is Brainfuck?

*From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck):*

Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller, and notable for its extreme minimalism.

The language consists of only eight simple commands and an instruction pointer. While it is fully Turing-complete, it is not intended for practical use, but to challenge and amuse programmers. Brainfuck simply requires one to break commands into microscopic steps.

The language's name is a reference to the slang term brainfuck, which refers to things so complicated or unusual that they exceed the limits of one's understanding.
